        <h3>Spanish Inquisition</h3>
        <article>
          I made this game because I have Spanish as one of the subjects in
          school. I wanted to improve my vocabulary by having fun and a game is
          a perfect solution for this problem. I made this in 24 hours. It is
          not perfect gameplay-wise but I learned some Spanish from it. So it
          kind of works.

        <h3>Audio recorder</h3>
        <article>
          Why did I make this program? Well, I couldn't find an audio recorder
          that had a global hotkey for recording. So I made one myself. I
          decided to use C++ and QT because I wanted it to be lightweight and
          cross-platform. Even though it is working, and it works quite well, I
          want to add ffmpeg support in the future.

          I loved watching Victorious when I was a little kid. I have rewatched
          it on Netflix recently and I decided to write a similar app that was
          on Victorious. Reggie is a happy bear that loves copying and saying
          back in his funny voice whatever you tell him. Talking Reggie is
          available on Google Play Store! It has over
          <strong>3,000</strong> downloads!
