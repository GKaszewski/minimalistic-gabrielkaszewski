          <h4>Preface</h4>
          <p>
            I've been thinking about writing this post since January. I sat down
            to write it several times at a time, but somehow I wasn't able to
            write it. Today, however, something nudged me and I took the plunge.
          </p>
          <h4>üñ±Ô∏è Technologies ‚öôÔ∏è</h4>
          <p>
            Okay then, let's start with the technologies I would like to learn
            or play with. At the very beginning it will be Rust. I've been
            thinking about Rust for quite some time, but somehow I've never
            moved it before more than out of curiosity some article/video I read
            or watched related to it. In January/February I started doing more
            'practical' things in Rust, I write that in quotes because it's
            still not anything useful, but it was so-called testing the waters.
            I did naturally hello-world and some simple calculator in the
            console and an attempt to create an endless runner using Bevy
            engine. Unfortunately, the runner was abandoned due to college
            sessions and a flurry of tasks at work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, Rust got me interested and I feel like writing some
            simple 2D games in it especially since it has options to export to
            WebAssembly which suits me because I plan to target mainly the web
            for my projects. Tauri also uses Rust, for those who don't know
            Tauri is a replacement for Electron, it allows cross-platform
            application development. I have two ideas for applications just in
            Tauri, but about them later.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second technology is Machine Learning. Machine learning has
            become more and more popular lately; the famous Chat GPT, or
            stable-diffusion, MidJourney and many other machine learning
            projects. Machine learning has interested me a lot since middle
            school, but somehow I can't grasp it. I understand the theory and
            how neural networks work, but I can't create a model that recognizes
            how many fingers we show, for example. I'd like to grasp this
            eventually and create one project I've been considering for about a
            year. It's a project that involves automatic audio de-noising, I
            know OBS has such filters, although I'd like to make my own software
            for this, yes for educational purposes. My next project is to
            automatically create .srt files based on song lyrics and audio. In
            January I created a mod for BeatSaber that adds song lyrics,
            unfortunately, the mod requires an srt file with the given time and
            lyrics. I would like to automate the process of creating these
            files, just using artificial intelligence to do it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last thing is game dev in a broad sense. Creating games in
            Typescript, making some games in VR in Unity, finishing a clone of
            Sammy Suricate, and super if I could make some simple strategy game.
            I love RTS games.

          <h4>Conclusion (none)</h4>
          <p>
            That's pretty much it at the moment, it's pretty late and I think
            I'll keep updating this post as something else pops into this crazy
            head of mine. For now, this is my farewell to you and I wish you a
            good day.
